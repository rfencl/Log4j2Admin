# Log4j2Admin
This is a simple utility for accessing Log4j2 loggers and changing the log levels with a browser.
The utility is written using jsp scriptlets and just needs to be placed in the root folder of your expanded web application.
No configuration is required.

The filter div is still under construction, but the tool is functional.
